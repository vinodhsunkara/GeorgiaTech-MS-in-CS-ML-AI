 * Knowledge Representation - Semantic Networks 
 * Generate & Test (Generate solutions applying semantic networks, test on answer options)
 * Means-Ends Analysis (step by step till goal)
 * Frames (frames of objects connected)
 * Learning by Recording Cases (Get nearby problem and apply that solution)
 * Case-based reasoning (Retrive closer problem and adapt solution)
 * Incremental Concept learning (generalization and specialization using positive and negative cases)
 * Meta-Reasoning (Reasoning about Agent's own learning)
